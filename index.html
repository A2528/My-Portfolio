                    On WhiteHatJr, I have learned coding on many applications and have created typical video games. Games such as Angry Bird, Ping Pong, Trex, Car racing and many other exciting games. I also got a chance to create my own game. Currently I am learning about the HTML language. </h1> </div class>
